     * The primary objective is to reduce the number of car stops and therefore the total journey time.
     *
     * A building served by L elevators can be split into up to L zones, where these m zones are either disjoint or not.
     * Cars in idle state are repositioned to the zoneâ€™s center level, therefore minimizing waiting time for passengers on adjacent floors.
     *
     * Static Zoning, zones are assigned permanently to a group of elevators.
